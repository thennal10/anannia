        <p class="title">A place for the marginalized to call home.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Chilla</strong>, translated as branch from Malayalam, is a foster home for the children of sex workers, HIV orphans and children-in-conflict with law â€“
            an initiative to give these children a fair chance to live and be connected with their mothers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chilla emphasizes the quality of life of the children, while they are at Chilla and after, by providing them with a home, 
            with education (in and outside school), and self-confidence. Anil and Roja, who run the home, are a unique couple who have 
            dedicated a good part of their lives to this cause. A sympathetic and pragmatic approach to the issue of sex work allows 
            Chilla to maintain good connections with the community of sex workers. The mothers themselves are involved in the project. 
            Chilla is supported by organisations like Kerala Partnership, Asha for Education and Sangama, as well as funds raised locally.
