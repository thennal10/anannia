            The digital divide is a stark reality facing the education sector of Kerela,
            as a significant portion of the children do not have access to any digital device
            necessary for attending online classes. In order to bridge the digital gap, we are
            conducting a donation drive to supply underpriviledged children with smartphones, costing
            roughly â‚¹7500. Every donation, no matter how small, helps in the cause. Donations of old
            but functional smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc. are also welcome.
