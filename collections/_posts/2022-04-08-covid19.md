            The toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is felt in many ways. Unemployed and with no means of sustenance, large parts of 
            our population are left starving and without basic medical supplies. In light of this fact, we at Anannia have cooperated 
            with Punyam, a California-based charitable organisation, to distribute 5 lakh rupees worth of
            food and medicine kits in the Karakulam panchayat. Food and Civil Supplies Minister G. R. Anil inagurated the program.
