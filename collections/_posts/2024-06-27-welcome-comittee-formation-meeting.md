A new training center, 'Chilla' Center for Habilitation, is being established in Karakulam's Mukola Ward to support individuals with autism and other mental or physical challenges. The center will provide free training for economically disadvantaged individuals, focusing on daily life skills and vocational training to enable sustainable income generation. To ensure the success of this event, a welcome committee was convened at Chilla.
