Me and two classmates, Silje and Karolina started a fundraiser via Facebook,
we had lessons in computer skills and english and just hung out with the kids. 
We participated in some meetings with students and one work shop. I really enjoyed 
spending time at Chilla and I think it's a genuine organization with good values.
