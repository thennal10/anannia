        <h1>Invitation for research collaboration</h1>
        <p>
            Through our work among marginalised children for the last 20 years, 
            we have found that a <b>wide chasm</b> exists between the opportunities 
            available for marginalised children and their peers. We've come to understand that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The family background of the children joining the primary school
                    reflects in their capability to involve in the classroom activities
                    and develop their potential. There is a huge difference among the
                    children from different social backgroundsâ€”especially between the
                    mainstream and the marginalized communities. This affects the performance
                    level of the marginalized children thereby widening the gap between
                    children of different social strata. Hence <b>imparting a quality
                    preschool education</b> is essential for enhancing their capability
                    to develop later on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the existing curriculum, the stories, songs and the cultural contexts
                    are those of mainstream society. The symbols, images and values that
                    represent the cultural premises and life situations of marginalized
                    sections like tribal communities are excluded. Even the language
                    used in formal schooling is different from that used in their communities in
                    terms of dialect and accent.
                    This leads to the <b>lack of interest</b> in attending school, 
                    thereby resulting in <b>higher dropout rate</b> among these communities.
                    Without addressing this cultural dissonance, these children will continue to play traunt.

                    Post-COVID, this gap in capability level has considerably
                    widened due to the difference in digital exposure among the marginalized and mainstream
                    communities. In Indian society, already marginalized communities are facing the <b>adverse
                    effects of the digital divide.</b> This has worsened as post-COVID educational methods increasingly rely on
                    digital means for education. Poor, discriminated, and stigmatized children are <b>not able
                    to acquire electronic devices</b> essential for this.
                </p>
            </li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this context a <b>clear action plan</b> has to be formulated for ensuring <b>quality preschool education</b> to marginalized
            children.
        </p>
        <p>
            Studies and research which will address the issues of marginalized children and increase their capability by invoking
            creative talents is highly essential in the field of preschool education. <b>ANANNIA is planning to do creative and
            constructive interventions in this area.</b> With our experience in overall personality development among marginalized
            children, we are planning to launch our new project <b>Early Childhood Education Research and Intervention.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            We are looking for research scholars with <b>experience in innovative educational practices</b>. This research intervention
            will be carried out in collaboration with Govt. educational agencies like DIET, SCERT and SSK. 
            Once this model succeeds, it can be adapted on a <b>broader scale</b> for a <b>long term curriculum
            redesign</b> with a view of inclusive education. With research studies in the Indian context it is expected to be <b>scalable</b>
            across the country, with <b>far-reaching social impact.</b>
