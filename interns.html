        <p class="has-text-justified-mobile">
            As an accredited NGO, Anannia has accepted dozens of interns, from Indian BTech students to Swedish
            social workers.
            Anyone with an interest to apply is able to either via their university or any such affiliated
            institution, or individually.<br>
            <strong>Contact us at chillaanil@gmail.com or annanniachilla@gmail.com for applications.</strong>

            <p class="has-text-justified-mobile">
                The major purpose of an internship is to depute qualified social workers to interact,
                asses and improve the overall development of children of Chilla and work for the future development
                of the CHILLA project. The impact of the work is two dimensional. The benefits gained by the children
                of CHILLA and the training the deputed social workers achieve through the process.
                The objective assessment by trained social workers will help us in streamlining our specific
                efforts regarding each child. By observing the children very closely they can identify the talents,
                issues and problems of each child. Further interaction with people with social concerns, is very
                important for our children in their blooming, especially since most of them have a very turbulent
                past.
                For the social workers, it will turn out to be a very good opportunity to get involved in the
                work among the most stigmatized and discriminated section of the society. They can closely
                observe how these children overcome their problems through love, care and cozy
                environment. They can play key role in the development of the institution, which will be a
                very good training for them.
